The Data Science Lab has world-leading expertise in the entire data value chain, from data acquisition, storage, representation and coding, to mining and learning from data, and finally valorization. The imprecise probability subunit conducts basic research on extensions of classical probability theory, uses these extensions to develop robust uncertainty models, and combines these models with data to perform reliable statistical inference and decision making.

In the recent past, SMACS and the imprecise probability subunit of Data Science Lab (then part of the SYSTeMS research group) have  joined forces to incorporate imprecise probability in queueing theory and its applications. This was a.o. substantiated in an FWO-project, and is expected to lead to a first Ph.D.-thesis in 2016. That project focussed on discrete-time stochastic processes, while queueing studies frequently adopt continuous-time models. Incorporating imprecision in this type of models is a challenge, as described further in the proposal, and it is this challenge that we intend to tackle in this new project.

%Joris Walraevens' research interests lie especially in modelling and analysis of heterogeneous networks and heterogeneity in the requirements of current network applications.
%It is in these applications of queueing theory that imprecision (or robustness) is a big factor: modelling the stochastic processes in queueing models is entirely based on information from traces (or even one single trace!), that consist of measurement data of current networks, and which are used as a source for prediction of future traffic patterns.
%The robustness of the performance of these heterogeneous and wireless networks to uncertainty in the offered traffic pattern (load, variance, (in)dependences, ...) is obviously of great practical importance.

Lots of text on queueing theory used to be here...

Basically, imprecise probability theory~\cite{augustin2013:itip,walley1991,troffaes2013:lp} is an extension of probability theory that allows for partial probability specifications.
For example, whenever it is infeasible to reliably estimate the probability of some event, this theory allows for the use of a probability interval instead.
Such partial specifications do not lead to a unique probability measure, but instead give rise to a set of compatible probability measures.
These sets of probability measures are called credal sets, and they are the basic uncertainty models in imprecise probability theory.
Lower and upper expectations, lower and upper probabilities, belief functions and possibility measures can all be regarded as special cases~\cite{walley2000}.
This approach is particularly useful when information is scarce, expensive, vague, or conflicting, in which case a unique probability measure may be hard to identify. Imprecise probability theory then takes this additional uncertainty into account, and produces robust analyses and decisions.

Despite the simplicity and elegance of the basic concept of imprecise probabilities, the resulting theory is extremely powerful.
Indeed, credal sets are very general, and can be used to model various types of uncertainty, ranging from pure stochastic uncertainty (a single probability measure) to a complete lack of knowledge (the set of all probability measures), and everything in between.
It should be stressed that imprecise probability theory is not just about taking a precise model and varying its parameters.
Additionally, it can also drop the traditional simplifying assumptions that were mentioned before, such as independence and stationarity, and can predict the effects of dropping these assumptions on output variables~\cite{couso1999b,walley1991,cozman2000}.

However, as is to be expected, the generality and flexibility of this approach comes at a price.
Inference in imprecise probability models tends to be computationally challenging, and it often requires high-dimensional non-linear optimisation problems to be solved.
Although state of the art research on imprecise probability has focussed rather extensively on the development of efficient computational inference methods, this line of research is ongoing, and many types of inference remain intractable.
Nevertheless, for the special case of discrete time imprecise stochastic processes, recent breakthroughs have led to the discovery of some powerful theoretical properties, which in turn have led to the development  of efficient (often linear or polynomial) algorithms~\cite{cooman2009,cooman2008}.
Rather remarkably, these algorithms can easily deal with different types of model uncertainty, even for stochastic processes that drop the usual independence or stationarity assumptions.

It should therefore not be surprising that these algorithms can be used to perform robust queueing analyses. Indeed, the algorithm in Reference \cite{cooman2008} was essential to the results in Reference~\cite{2015Lopatatzidis}, where the authors considered a discrete-time queue of finite length with a single server and Bernoulli arrivals and departures, and robustified it in the following way.
Instead of assuming that the probability of a Bernoulli arrival (or departure) is known exactly, they assumed that this parameter takes (unknown) values in some known interval. They also allowed this parameter to be non-stationary, and dropped the stochastic independence assumption by replacing it by weaker imprecise independence notions, such as repetition independence and epistemic irrelevance.
Even with all these layers of robustness in place, it was still possible to efficiently perform queueing analyses with this model, and these analyses furthermore led to some surprising new insights. For example, in the precise case, it follows from ergodicity that the limiting distribution of the number of customers is equal to their time-averaged distribution. However, because ergodicity breaks down in the imprecise case~\cite{deCooman2015}, these two distributions are not equally robust: the analysis in Reference~\cite{2015Lopatatzidis} showed that dropping the independence assumption can result in substantial changes to the steady state state distribution, but that the effect on the time-averaged distribution is less profound.

%This is a consequence of the fact that ergodicity does not necessarily hold for imprecise Markov chains with finite state sets, something which has been proven in \todo{\cite{deCooman2015} @Jasper: Of vertel ik hier onzin?}.

%\todo{Joris: het bovenstaande vind ik een beetje (te?) uitgebreid}

Nevertheless, despite this initial success and the new insights that resulted from it, there is still an important mismatch between imprecise probability theory and queueing models.
On the one hand, most of queueing theory is developed for continuous-time models: although synchronization in telecommunication networks has sparked a surge of analyses of discrete-time models from the nineties onwards, continuous-time models are still the standard.
On the other hand, imprecise probability theory has advanced almost unanimously for discrete-time stochastic processes.
Imprecise continuous-time models have been explored only very recently \cite{Skulj2015,Troffaes+GSB-ISIPTA15p}, and many basic theoretical and computational problems have yet to be solved.

\textbf{Describe the objectives of the research.}\\
\textit{Describe the envisaged research and the research hypothesis, why it is important to the field, what impact it could have, whether and how it is specifically unconventional and challenging.}

*** this is a part of the text of some previous proposal, which could serve as an example of the type of text we are looking for here ***

The main objective of the proposed project is to \emph{use imprecise probabilities to develop a general framework for robust continuous-time queueing models}, in which the  imprecision of the input stochastic processes and their parameters is not ignored, but instead explicitly included. This framework will be able to predict the effect of this imprecision on relevant performance measures, for example by providing bounds on their expected value, and can then be used to make safer design choices that are robust against modelling errors.

%The inferences of these models are a set of output distributions rather than one completely specified distribution and are therefore robust against imprecision in the input distributions.

Key in the success of this proposal will be the development of \emph{efficient algorithms} that can, for example, compute the aforementioned bounds. To this end, imprecise probability for \emph{continuous-time} stochastic processes will have to be developed. This will be a challenging line of research, because the topic is almost completely unexplored: to the best of our knowledge, References~\cite{Troffaes+GSB-ISIPTA15p} and~\cite{Skulj2015} are the only exceptions. However, given our experience in designing efficient algorithms for imprecise \emph{discrete-time} stochastic processes~\cite{cooman2008} and applying them to discrete-time queueing theory~\cite{2015Lopatatzidis}, we are convinced that we have the necessary background to successfully tackle similar problems in continuous-time.

If successful, this research has the potential to disrupt the queueing theory paradigm.
Indeed, the Achilles' heel of using (predominantly continuous-time) queueing models for decision support, prediction and dimensioning in practical applications is the fact that usually, these models and their calibration are uncertain themselves.
In an attempt to deal with this issue, the goal of queueing theory in the last hundred years has been to analyse increasingly generalised, complicated and intricate queueing models.
Although successful on its own, this approach often inspires overconfidence in its results, and gaining confidence in the input distributions is not treated with the same attention or is neglected altogether.
Once numbers are produced, the dependency on the input is often forgotten all too easily.
Instead, we plan to develop a (continuous-time) queueing theory that takes this dependency into account. In this theory, it is explicitly acknowledged that we do not know the input precisely, and, as a result, the resulting output and decisions are robust with respect to this imprecision. Furthermore, calibration of the input will be much easier, and we are convinced that efficient algorithms are in the picture as well.

The proposed research is unconventional from the perspective of both domains that intersect in this project.
First of all, although some attempts at robustifying queueing theory have already been undertaken (see the state-of-the-art section), it is still unconventional in queueing theory to drift away from precise probabilities. Even more unconventional is that the described approach also breaks with traditional assumptions such as stochastic independence, the Markov property and so on, which also results in infringements of ergodicity in cases where ergodicity comes natural in precise probability.
From an imprecise probability perspective, the models are unconventional because time is taken to be continuous, whereas past research on imprecise stochastic processes has focussed almost unanimously on discrete-time problems.

*** this is a part of the text of some previous proposal, which could serve as an example of the type of text we are looking for here ***

The first step in this project will be to \emph{develop robust versions of the basic building blocks of queueing models, that is, imprecise arrival and service-time processes} {\bf(Work Package 1)}.
Initially, given their popularity and importance, we will focus on developing imprecise versions of Poisson processes and exponential distributions, with increasing degrees of robustness.
A first level of robustness will be added by allowing the parameter of Poisson processes and exponential distributions to vary within intervals.
Next, additional layers of robustness will be added by allowing this parameter to be time-dependent and eventually even history-dependent.
We intend to achieve this in a very rigorous way, by dropping the independence axioms that are traditionally used to define Poisson processes and exponential distributions, and replacing them with increasingly weaker axioms.
Each additional layer of robustness will result in a more flexible and realistic uncertainty model, at the cost of increased theoretical and computational complexity.
However, given that the Data Science Lab has already successfully tackled this kind of issues for discrete-time robust stochastic processes~\cite{hermansITIP}, we expect to be able to obtain similar successes in this continuous-time case. In a later stage, we will try to robustify other continuous-time distributions and arrival processes, such as Erlang distributions and Markovian arrival processes.

The second step in this project consists in using the imprecise arrival and service-time processes of the first step to \emph{develop robust queueing models} {\bf(Work Package 2)}.
Basically, the idea is to consider existing queueing models, and to replace their arrival and service-time processes by our imprecise versions.
We intend to start by developing a robust version of the $M/M/1$ queue, where customers arrive according to an imprecise Poisson process, one server serves the waiting customers in an FCFS order, and service times have an imprecise exponential distribution.
In the precise case, the number of customers in the queue can then be described by a continuous-time birth-death chain.
Similarly, we would like to show that in the imprecise case, the number of customers can be described by a continuous-time imprecise birth-death chain, which is a simple type of continuous-time imprecise Markov chain~\cite{Skulj2015}.
Similarly, for more complex queueing models, we intend to show that the number of customers can be described by more complex imprecise Markov chains.

Clearly, step two will require us to \emph{establish a rigorous theoretical basis for continuous-time imprecise Markov chains}, and we regard this as a third part of this research {\bf(Work Package 3)}, which we intend to initiate before---and then continue in parallel with---the second step. Some preliminary research has already been conducted on this topic~\cite{Skulj2015}, including some recent unpublished work by the imprecise probability subunit of the Data Science Lab, but it is fair to say that there are still many unsolved basic theoretical and computational problems left. For example, past research on imprecise continous-time Markov chains only considered finite state spaces, whereas basic queueing theory often considers countably many states. %\todo{*** what do you mean by that? ***} *** references ***

The three steps that were discussed above are purely theoretical, and consist of developing a formal framework in which to study imprecise arrival and service-time processes, imprecise Markov chains, and ways of combining these to construct robust queueing models.
In order to be able to use these models in practice, this formal framework will need to be complemented with efficient computational methods.
In particular, it will be necessary to develop methods that are able to provide us with exact bounds on performance measures---such as the average occupancy or delay---that reflect the extent to which the imprecision in the input affects the output.
Indeed, once we have these bounds, they can then be used to make robust a priori design choices while dimensioning a queueing system, such as determining the needed buffer space or the desired number of servers, in order to achieve the desired performance.
Similarly, for systems whose number of servers can vary over time, these bounds can be used to design robust dynamic server policies.
Given the importance of these bounds, a fourth step in this project will be to \emph{extend the existing computational methods for continuous-time imprecise Markov chains}~\cite{Skulj2015,Troffaes+GSB-ISIPTA15p}, and to \emph{use these methods to efficiently compute exact bounds on performance measures} {\bf(Work Package 4)}.

Although we expect to reach the majority of the above goals, it might of course happen that we do not. For example, some types of performance measures might turn out to be inherently intractable to compute with, or we might come across stochastic processes for which adding three layers of robustness (allowing their parameters to be interval-valued, time- and history dependent) results in a model that is simply too complex to work with. However, even if we were to come across such problems, this will not endanger the global aim of the first part of this project, which is to develop robust continuous-time queueing models. Indeed, there are various types of stochastic processes, increasingly complex ways of adding robustness, and many performance measures of interest. Adding a modest amount of robustness to simple queueing models will definitely be possible, and this alone suffices to continue with the rest of this project. However, of course, our intention is to go much further: ideally, we would like to develop a general framework for working with robust continuous-time queueing models.
%In any case, regardless on how general our study ends up being, we definitely expect to be able to develop robust continuous-time queueing models, and this will allow us to move to a next step.

As should have become clear from the explanation above, our proposed research does not work towards a specific application, neither does it try to build an ad hoc model for some specific problem.
Instead, our aim is to build a general framework for robust continuous-time queueing theory.
Nevertheless, if we succeed in developing such a general framework, then of course, it can be used to study and solve a variety of problems, in different types of queueing applications. In order to demonstrate this, we intend to \emph{use our framework to analyse one or two specific queueing applications} {\bf(Work Package 5)}.
Our choice of applications will depend on the level of complexity that our framework is able to deal with, but since robustness is an essential feature of our approach, we intend to focus on problems where this feature is important, that is, applications where the exact values of the parameters of the model are uncertain (e.g. telecommunication) and/or non-stationary (e.g. call centres \cite{Defraeye20164}).

The purpose of this applied side of the project is only to test and validate the usefulness of our theory. Therefore, tackling this applied part will not require us to learn imprecise stochastic processes from data (e.g.\ Internet traces). For the purposes of this project, we can simply start from precise stochastic processes---learnt by means of existing methods, that is, by proposing a model that is deemed adequate and then applying estimation theory (see e.g.\ \cite{Breuer2002}) to estimate its parameters---and can then add increasing amounts of imprecision to these precise stochastic processes in order to study the robustness of the resulting outputs. %The initial precise model can then be learnt by means of existing methods, that is, by proposing a model that is deemed adequate and then applying estimation theory (see e.g.\ \cite{Breuer2002}) to estimate its parameters.
However, in a later phase, it would of course be better to \emph{develop methods for learning imprecise continuous-time stochastic processes directly from data} {\bf(Work Package 6)}. At this point, we envision that this last topic will only be marginally treated in the project. However, if necessary, it does provide us with a contingency plan that is of independent interest.

A Ph.D.\ fellowship, and therefore also the work on the proposed research, is spread over a period of four years.
I have indicated these four years in Table~\ref{tab:timing}, and have divided every year in four periods of three months (i.e. quarters).
The work of the proposed research was already divided in work packages in the previous section.
For each work package, Table~\ref{tab:timing} provides a short description (CT stands for `continuous-time') and indicates the quarters during which I expect to be working on it.
I tick the box of a quarter with an x to indicate almost certainties; these are the quarters during which I expect to definitely spend time on the indicated work package.
I use o's to tick boxes of which I am not yet certain that I will need and/or use them.
These o-quarters are used to absorb setbacks or to allow for some flexibility, and indicate the maximum amount of time that I intend to spend on a given work package. As explained in our methodology, the work on (WP2) is initiated after the work on (WP3) because it relies on some of its results. Furthermore, as also explained before, (WP6) is currently not at the core of the proposed research, but can serve as a contingency plan if necessary.
